    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Stam Sofer ("we" or "the app") is an open-source application designed to help scribes (Sofer Stam) edit and manage their texts. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data.</p>

    <h2>Google User Data</h2>
    <p>Our app accesses your Google Drive to allow you to save and edit your documents directly from the app. Here is how we handle your data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access:</strong> The app requests access to your Google Drive files to list, open, and save files managed by the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Use:</strong> We use this access solely to display your files within the app and save your edits back to your Drive.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> The app does not store your files on any external servers. Files are processed locally on your device and synchronized directly with Google Drive.</li>
        <li><strong>Sharing:</strong> We do not share, sell, or transfer your Google user data to any third parties or advertising tools.</li>
